## Overview:

> This is a project from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s
> Full-Stack JS curriculum.

In this project I try to better organize my code better using, functions,
factories, objects and concepts like closures and IIFE.

### Game Flow:

- The game will have two players:
  1. "X"
  2. "O";
- Whichever player gets their 3 of their avatar in a straight line, row, column
  or diagonally, wins. Else the game is recorded as a draw.
- After each round, the scoreboard is updated to reflect the outcome of the
  round.

### Process:

- Designed in figma "successfully" for the first time. It's ugly, yes I know.
  But I'm proud of it. Hoping to improve with time.

- Built the design, with some improvements. I used the mobile-first approach for
  a fully responsive UI - mobile, tablet, desktop.

- Implemented the core logic for the game.
  - I tried my best to use IIFEs but I ended up only using one which isn't
    great. Need to work on that.
  - I think I've got a hang on closures. I think I used it well in this project.
    Still room to improve.

## What I Learnt:

- Dev work is much more than building small stuff quickly. You can spread the
  project over multiple days to maintain peak effort and focus.
- Building on the earlier, leaving good comments as mentioned numerous times by
  experienced devs, is a great habit.
